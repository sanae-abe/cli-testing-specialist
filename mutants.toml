# Timeout settings (in seconds)
# If a test takes longer than this, the mutant is considered "timed out"
timeout = 300  # 5 minutes per mutant

# Test command to run for each mutant
# By default, cargo-mutants runs `cargo test` but we exclude integration tests
test_tool = "cargo"

# Minimum test time (in seconds) to consider a mutant "caught"
# If tests pass too quickly, the mutant might not be properly tested

# Baseline test time multiplier
# Mutants that take more than baseline * this value are considered "timeout"

# Additional options
[options]
# Show caught mutants in the output (not just missed/timeout)
show_caught = true

# Show times for each mutant

# Use cargo nextest if available (faster test execution)
# nextest = true
